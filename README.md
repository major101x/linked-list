# LinkedList

This is a LinkedList project from TheOdinProject where I was told to write a linkedList as well as various functions for managing the data on the list. These are the methods I wrote:

- `append(value)` adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
- `prepend(value)` adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
- `size` returns the total number of nodes in the list
- `head` returns the first node in the list
- `tail` returns the last node in the list
- `at(index)` returns the node at the given index
- `pop` removes the last element from the list
- `contains(value)` returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
- `find(value)` returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
- `toString` represents the LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format is: 
```javascript
( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null
```
- `insertAt(value, index)` inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
- `removeAt(index)` removes the node at the given index.

## Lessons Learned 
I learned about objects and how to traverse nested objects. I also learned how to use pointers to iterate through data. Finally, I solidified my knowledge of classes and how to use class methods and constructors. I will be using classes instead of factory functions from now on.
